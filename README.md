# Psychic-Game

This game is a simplified letter guessing game. The computer chooses a random letter and the user has a set amount of tries to guess what it is. 

If the user is succesful, a win is tallied, otherwise a loss is tallied. 

If a non-alphabetic letter is chosen, the game promts the user to choose one. 

Megan Evans coded the game mechanics and designed the fabulous Psyduck themed layout.
